    "the interpreter evaluates it, which means that it finds the value of the expression.\n",

    "\n",
    "A statement is a unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a value.When we type a statement,\n",
    "the interpreter executes it, which means that it does whatever the statement says. In general, statements donâ€™t have values.\n",
    "\n",
